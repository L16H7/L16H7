## Hello, world!
I am Lin. I am doing AI research.

I believe in intelligence.
Intelligence can be harnessed and it can be used to create near perfect world.
If we can create intelligence, we have a moral responsibility to do so.

I am Burmese so here's my favorite quote in Burmese.
"ငုပ်မိသဲတိုင် တက်နိုင်ဖျားရောက်"
Loose translation: "If you dive, touch the sea floor. If you climb, reach the summit."

In machine learning, it's like "If you minimize loss, hit the global minimum. If you optimize reward, go for the global maximum."
Mic drop!
