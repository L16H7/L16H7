## Hello, world!
I am Lin. I am doing AI research.

I believe in intelligence.
Intelligence can be harnessed to create a near-perfect world.
If we have the ability to create intelligence, we have a moral responsibility to do so.

### AI Research (2025–Present)

### Research areas and interests
- Reinforcement Learning
- Meta Learning
- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Background: Software Engineering (2018–2024)

I am Burmese so here's my favorite quote in Burmese.
"ငုပ်မိသဲတိုင် တက်နိုင်ဖျားရောက်"
Loose translation: "If you dive, touch the sea floor. If you climb, reach the summit."

In machine learning, it's like "If you minimize loss, hit the global minimum. If you optimize reward, go for the global maximum."
Mic drop!

### Recent Experiments
Outside of my research interests, I occassionally explore several research topics and experiments.
